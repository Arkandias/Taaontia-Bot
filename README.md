# Taaontia-Bot

## Sounds fine, what's this?

A personnal Discord RPG Bot project, based on my original The Amazing Adventure of not that Interresting Adventurers idea.
It will feature procedurally all that I had in mind but didn't quite found the motivation to do in the original project.


## What does it use?

It will be written in C#.NETCore, for fancy compatibility with Windows, Linux and (sadly?) OSX, using the libraries some cool developpers have made for this purpose.


## Cool, but what's with this name?

That's the only name I came with. I'm deeply sorry.
